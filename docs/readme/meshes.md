# Meshes

This document describes how meshes are handled in AshEngine.

Currently, the `Mesh` struct (`ashengine/engine/src/mesh.rs`) is a placeholder. This section will be updated once the `Mesh` struct and its associated functionality are fully implemented.

TODO: Update this section with details about the `Mesh` struct, including how to create, load, and render meshes.

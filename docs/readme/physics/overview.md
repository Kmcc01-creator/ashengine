# Physics System Overview

The AshEngine physics system provides a robust implementation of both traditional Newtonian physics for rigid bodies and Position-Based Dynamics (PBD) for soft bodies and deformable objects. The system is designed for performance and scalability, utilizing parallel processing and efficient spatial partitioning.

## Architecture

The physics system is organized into several key components:

### Core Components

- **Physics World**: Central manager for all physical objects and simulation
- **Physics Objects**: Two main types:
  - Rigid Bodies: Traditional solid objects with mass and inertia
  - Deformable Bodies: Soft objects using position-based dynamics

### Key Features

#### Rigid Body Physics

- Full 6-DOF (degrees of freedom) simulation
- Angular motion with quaternion-based rotation
- Efficient collision response with restitution and friction
- Constraint-based interaction system

#### Soft Body Physics

- Position-Based Dynamics (PBD) implementation
- Volume preservation constraints
- Tetrahedral mesh support for deformable bodies
- Particle-based simulation with constraints

#### Collision Detection

- Broad-phase using spatial hashing
- Narrow-phase with oriented bounding boxes
- Support for rigid-rigid, soft-soft, and rigid-soft collisions
- Efficient contact point generation

#### Performance Optimizations

- Parallel processing using rayon
- Cache-efficient spatial partitioning
- Island-based constraint solving
- SIMD operations for particle systems

## Usage Example

```rust
use ashengine::physics::{PhysicsWorld, PhysicsObject};
use glam::Vec3;

// Create a physics world with gravity
let mut world = PhysicsWorld::new(Vec3::new(0.0, -9.81, 0.0));

// Add a rigid body
let rigid_body = PhysicsObject::new_rigid_body(
    Vec3::new(0.0, 10.0, 0.0), // position
    1.0,                        // mass
    Vec4::splat(1.0),          // bounding box
);
world.add_object(rigid_body);

// Add a soft body
let soft_body = PhysicsObject::new_deformable_body(
    positions,    // Vec<Vec3>
    masses,       // Vec<f32>
    tetrahedra,   // Vec<[usize; 4]>
    1.0,         // bounding size
);
world.add_object(soft_body);

// Add constraints between objects
world.add_constraint(Box::new(DistanceConstraint::new(0, 1, 2.0)));

// Run simulation
let delta_time = 1.0 / 60.0;
world.update(delta_time);
```
